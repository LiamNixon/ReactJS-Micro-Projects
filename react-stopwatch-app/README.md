# Simple Stopwatch App
A simple little stopwatch app that I created with React in VisualStudio Code to learn the basics of React hooks, functions, state and other fun stuff!

## Interface
The interface will show you the stopwatch's current time and the relevant time units (hh = hours, mm = minutes, ss = seconds) which will update as the watch runs.
Below are two buttons, a start/stop (dynamically changes) button and a reset button, which will set all the time values back to 0!
